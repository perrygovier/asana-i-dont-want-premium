# Instructions

I don't want to publish this to the marketplace since it's deliberately breaking part of Asana. That upsell alert after downgrading from premium is just too much though. 

**To install**:

1. Download the zip of this repo
2. Open up chrome extensions `chrome://extensions/`
3. Turn on "Developer mode" 
4. Click "Load unpacked" and open this unzipped directory
5. Enjoy Asana again
